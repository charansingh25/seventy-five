# Seventy-Five

Seventy-Five is a modern attendance application designed for educational institutions, leveraging WiFi and WiFi hotspot technology to streamline the attendance process. This app allows teachers to efficiently mark student attendance without the need for traditional roll calls, improving classroom efficiency.

## Overview
This project implements an attendance system that utilizes WiFi and Bluetooth features. It offers two distinct modes: one for teachers and one for students.

### How It Works
- **Teacher Mode**: Teachers create a WiFi hotspot using their device and share a unique code (the WiFi hotspot key) with students.
- **Student Mode**: Students connect to the teacher's WiFi network by entering the provided key/password.
- Each time attendance is taken, the teacher’s device creates a WiFi hotspot, which students connect to. After connecting, the students’ devices broadcast their details, confirming their presence before disconnecting.

This project features an updated modern UI design and retains a record of student attendance.
